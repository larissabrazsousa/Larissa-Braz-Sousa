# Larissa Braz Sousa

I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in School Science Education using Citizen Science, at the University of Sydney. I lead the [Learning by Doing](https://lbdscience.com) project, exploring citizen science as an approach to science democratisation, making scientific research more accessible and understandable. My recent research focused on citizen science mosquito surveillance to enhance public health literacy and education outcomes. I am also a science teacher from Brazil and a passionate science communicator and citizen science facilitator. I co-founded the not-for-profit [_Ferox australis_](https://www.feroxaustralis.org) and the global citizen science initiative [Great Southern Bioblitz](https://www.greatsouthernbioblitz.org). You can find me on [ORCID](https://orcid.org/my-orcid?orcid=0000-0003-4330-4277), [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Larissa-Braz-Sousa) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LarissaBrazSous).
